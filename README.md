# lumicube-daemon

LumiCube service for the Raspberry Pi.

## Building

You can build this using Maven (either from the command-line, or e.g. using NetBeans).

The resulting .zip (containing all the JAR files) can either be extracted and run directly, or packaged with a JVM into an AppImage using build.sh.

Note: This last step requires Docker (and therefore also root permissions).
